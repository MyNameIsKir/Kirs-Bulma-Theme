# Kir's Bulma Theme

This is simply a copy of the [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/) except with some minor customization of colors and fonts, as well as a demo HTML page so that I can quickly make a visual reference.

#### Setup
To setup, run the following:
```
npm install
npm run css-build```
Then, use `/css/kirs-theme.css` in your project.
